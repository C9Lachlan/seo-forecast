I want to write a python script to predict the amount of organic traffic a website will receive in the future. The script will use the following libraries:
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

The program will be built in streamlit

There will be a "Ahrefs Traffic Data" CSV input in a sidebar. The csv will have 17 columns, but we will only use Dates (Under the heading "Metric"), Referring domains, and Avg. organic traffic. Skip the second and third lines when reading this csv. 

I want this data to be split into two different data sets, forecast_data and test_data. test_data will contain the most recent 182 days of data. forecast_data will contain the rest of the data.

forecast_data will be used with prophet to predict traffic for the next 182 days. That prediction will then be compared to the the data in test_data to see how accurate the forecast was. 

I want there to be a table output which which lists the Mean Absolute Percentage Error for each day. 

Make a graph output which shows both sets of data, as well as the forecast line.

There should also be a text output which shows the Weighted Average Percentage Error. 

There are some additional requirements. 
I would like a set of tick boxes that changes which factors are included in the prophet forecast:

A "Weekly seasonality" tickbox. If ticked, weekly_seasonality is true and if not ticked, weekly_seasonality is false.

A "algorithm updates" tickbox. If ticked, this list of dates that the algorithm changed should also be included as regressors:
November 11, 2024
August 15, 2024
June 20, 2024
May 14, 2024
May 6, 2024
March 5, 2024
November 8, 2023
November 2, 2023
October 5, 2023
October 4, 2023
September 14, 2023
August 22, 2023
April 12, 2023
March 15, 2023
February 21, 2023
December 14, 2022
December 5, 2022
October 19, 2022
September 20, 2022
September 12, 2022

If not ticked, do not use these dates.

A "Referring domains" tickbox. If ticked, include Referring domains from the csv as an extraneous variable in the prophet forecast. If not ticked, do not include referring domains. 

A "Changepoint Range" text box. Whatever value is placed in this text box should define the changepoint_range used in the model. By default the changepoint_range should be 0.9.

A "Trend flexibility" text box. Whatever value is placed in this text box should define the changepoint_prior_scale used in the model. By default the changepoint_range should be 0.05.
